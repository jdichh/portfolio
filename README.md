My personal portfolio. This will be continually improved as I improve.

Update as of 9/23/2023: I've recently remade my portfolio in Next.js 13 [here](https://jdichh.vercel.app/), and [this](https://github.com/jdichh/portfolio-next) is the GitHub repo for it. <br> This is the [old version](https://jdichh.netlify.app/) for comparison.
